This is the final project of the Python 3 programming course from the University of Michigan on Coursera website.

The assignment was to take a ZIP file with paper pages, cut and paste people's faces on a black sheet if the required search name was found in the page text.

The libraries used:
PILLOW
pytesseract
cv2
NumPy

We had a little example about the libraries and had to figure out how they work together from the documentation.
